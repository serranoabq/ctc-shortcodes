CTC Shortcodes (Plugin)
==========================

A WordPress plugin that used to display [Church Theme Content Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/church-theme-content/) content using shortcodes.

Description
-----------

CTC Shortcodes is a a plugin for a plugin. It is designed to allow users of the [Church Theme Content Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/church-theme-content/) to display some of the content stored by the CTC plugin from within their posts and pages, even if the theme isn't CTC-compatible. 

Installation
------------

Please see [Installing Plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins) in the WordPress Codex for general installation instructions.

CTC Shortcodes requires the [Church Theme Content Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/church-theme-content/) as well, so make sure it is also installed. A compatible theme isn't required, but is recommended. To create a compatible theme, please see the [CTC Developer Guide](http://churchthemes.com/guides/developer/church-theme-content/).

*TBD*


Notes
-----

CTC Shortcodes only handles the information display, not the backend related to the custom post types created by the CTC plugin. To request features related to the CTC plugin, go to the [support](http://wordpress.org/plugin/support/church-theme-content/) page for the CTC Plugin.

I have created a fork of the CTC plugin which adds additional recurrance features, such as daily recurrence and Nth day/week/month/year recurrence to the CTC Plugin. You can find it on [GitHub](http://github.com/serranoabq/church-theme-content/develop). Note that this is an unsupported fork. Steven Gliebe and ChurchThemes.com are not associated with this fork.
