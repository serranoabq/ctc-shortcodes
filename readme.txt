Provides users of the [Church Theme Content Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/church-theme-content/) (CTC) a way to include the content managed by CTC into their pages by using shortcodes. Keeping with the plugin->content, theme->design paradigm, the shortcodes outuput a basic, unstyled layout for the content. Styling is left to the theme designer. Additionally, a template can be included in the theme to use for the display. 

== Description ==

CTC Shortcodes is intended to help individuals and churches using the the [Church Theme Content plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/church-theme-content/) to easily include the content stoded and managed by CTC into their posts and pages. Because the intent of plugins should by be to deal with content, not style, CTC refrains from producing any useful output unles a "compatible theme" is used. I believe that by using a templatable shortcode paradigm we can mantain the separation between content and style. A basic output enables the display of the data; a theme stylesheet must be used to provide styling. Additionally, the output can be further managed by including appropriate templates within a theme. 

== Installation ==

Please see [Installing Plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins) in the WordPress Codex. The available shortcodes will present a basic unstyled layout when used. To style the output, the theme must include an appropriate stylesheet. To change the output content, the theme must include an appropriate template. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin with any theme? =

Yes, the shortcodes will work even without a CTC-compatible theme. That is the point. However, for styling the shortcode output or for changing the output style 

However, without a compatible theme, the event page, accessible by clicking on the event title on the calendar will not display all of the rich event information, such as date, time, venue, etc., that is available with the CTC Plugin. To create a compatible theme, please see the [CTC Developer Guide](http://churchthemes.com/guides/developer/church-theme-content/).
